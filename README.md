# migrate-rethinkdb
A migration tool for RethinkDB

## Overview

`migrate-rethinkdb` is a utility allowing you to version
changes to a [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com) database. Forward
or backward migrate structural or data changes. Share
and control these changes with other developers.

This code is a fork of Johan Obrink's
[rethink-migrate](https://github.com/JohanObrink/rethink-migrate).
`migrate-rethinkdb` is more actively maintained.


## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g migrate-rethinkdb
```

## Setup

Install a RethinkDB driver:

```bash
npm install --save rethinkdb
```

or

```bash
npm install --save rethinkdbdash
```

Create a ```database.json``` file in the root of your solution with the format:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 28015,
  "db": "migrations",
  "discovery": true,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

Other, optional, parameters are `authKey` and `ssl`.

You can also use environment variables or arguments to override.

### Log levels

The default is info. This will log info, warnings and errors. Possible
values for logLevel are "debug" | "info" | "warning" | "error" | "none".

## Create migration

```bash
$ migrate-rethinkdb create [migration name]
```

For example:

```bash
migrate-rethinkdb create add-tables
```

## Edit migration

Open the file `./migrations/[timestamp]-[migration name].js`

Add the changes to be made. For example:

```javascript
exports.up = function (r, connection) {
  return r.tableCreate('foo').run(connection);
};

exports.down = function (r, connection) {
  return r.tableDrop('foo').run(connection);
};
```

## Run migrations

`migrate-rethinkdb up` will run all outstanding up migrations.

`migrate-rethinkdb down` will run one down migration.

`migrate-rethinkdb down --all` will run all outstanding down migrations.

### Options

`migrate-rethinkdb up --root ./build` will run all outstanding up migrations
  found in `./build/migrations` with `database.json` in `./build`.
`-r` can be used as an alias.

`migrate-rethinkdb up --logLevel debug` will set logLevel to debug.
  Possible values are: debug | info | warning | error | none.
`-l` can be used as an alias.

## Run tests

Run `docker-compose up`
If necessary, change the IP address in `test/database.json`
Run `gulp jshint test`

To run tests continually, add `watch` to the gulp command
