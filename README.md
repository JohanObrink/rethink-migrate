# rethink-migrate
A migration tool for rethink db

## Version 1.2

Breaking change: In order to support rethinkdbdash, the format of the migrations has
been changed from
```exports.up = function (connection) {``` and ```exports.down = function (connection) {```
to
```exports.up = function (r, connection) {``` and ```exports.down = function (r, connection) {```

## Install

```npm install -g rethink-migrate```

## Setup

Install a rethinkdb driver:

```bash
npm install --save rethinkdb
```

or

```bash
npm install --save rethinkdbdash
```

Create a ```database.json``` file in the root of your solution with the format:

```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 28015,
  "db": "migrations",
  "discovery": true,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

Other, optional, parameters are ```authKey``` and ```ssl```.

You can also use environment variables or arguments to override.

### Log levels

The default is info. This will log info, warnings and errors. Possible values for logLevel are "debug" | "info" | "warning" | "error" | "none".

## Create migration

```rethink-migrate create [migration name]```

For example: ```rethink-migrate create add-tables```

## Edit migration

Open the file ```./migrations/[timestamp]-[migration name].js```

Add the changes to be made. For example:

```javascript
exports.up = function (r, connection) {
  return r.tableCreate('foo').run(connection);
};

exports.down = function (r, connection) {
  return r.tableDrop('foo').run(connection);
};
```
## Run migrations

```rethink-migrate up``` will run all outstanding up migrations.

```rethink-migrate down``` will run one down migration.

```rethink-migrate down --all``` will run all outstanding down migrations.

### Options

```rethink-migrate up --root ./build``` will run all outstanding up migrations
  found in ./build/migrations with database.json in ./build.
```-r```can be used
  as an alias.

```rethink-migrate up --logLevel debug``` will set logLevel to debug.
  Possible values are: debug | info | warning | error | none.
```-l```can be used as an alias.

## Run tests

In order to run the tests, you must have a rethinkdb instance running. You can
either start it locally in you machine or use the `docker-compose up` command to
start a dockerized version of rethinkdb. In any case, you must set the IP of
your running rethinkdb instance as the `host` address in the file
`test/database.json` before running tests

Use `npm test` to actually run the test suite.

To run tests continually, use `gulp test watch`
